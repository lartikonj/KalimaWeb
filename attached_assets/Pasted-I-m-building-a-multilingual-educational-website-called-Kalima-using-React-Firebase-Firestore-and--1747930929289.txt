I’m building a multilingual educational website called Kalima using React + Firebase (Firestore and Authentication only — no Firebase Storage). The goal is to let users read and enjoy educational articles in 5 languages: Arabic, English, French, Spanish, and German. Please structure the app with the following features:

🔐 Authentication
Firebase Authentication with email/password login

Users stored in Firestore with:

uid (string)

displayName (string)

email (string)

favorites (array of article IDs)

suggestedArticles (array of maps):

title (string)

language (string)

content (array of strings)

📄 Articles Collection (articles)
slug (string) — unique for URLs

availableLanguages (array of strings) — e.g., ["en", "fr", "ar"]

translations (map):

Keyed by language code ("en", "fr", etc.), each contains:

title (string)

summary (string)

category (string)

subcategory (string)

content (array of strings or paragraphs)

createdAt (timestamp)

draft (boolean)

imageUrl (string) — use Unsplash API to fetch relevant royalty-free images based on title or category

🗂️ Categories & Subcategories (hardcoded in app)
